<h2>1. Design</h2>
<br><br>

One of the biggest complaints about Internet Explorer back when it was one of the few browsers available, was how clunky it made users feel. <br>After Firefox’s release, many left a bad impression to what Mozilla released because of how they revamped what a browser should look like. <br>Then, Chrome hit the web, and more users jumped ship to its simple, clean user interface. Chrome also boasts a large library of HD themes included under the extension banner. <br>These themes range from your favorite sports teams to color schemes and more. <br>These themes are easily installed, require no restart to start using and can make your browser more like you and your desktop theme.
<br>
<br><h2>2. Searching from the Address Bar</h2><br>

Typing in Google.com in your address bar, waiting for it to load and then typing what you want to look for online is not a terribly difficult process. <br> However, Chrome takes those three steps and combines them into one with the use of its address bar. Just type in what you want to look for.

<br>
<br><h2>3. Incognito mode</h2><br>

Incognito Mode allows you to surf the web without worrying about browsing history, download history or cookies. <br> These are all deleted when you close the browser. Any changes you make to settings or bookmarks are saved for you. <br>You just do not have to worry about others seeing where you are surfing, what you are downloading and whether or not your cookies are being stored.<br>

<br><h2>Next app is Coinmarketcap.com. </h2><br> This is a Site where you can monitor crypto and know where to trade them.

<br>Why do I love this app? And what is this app anyway? This app serves like a price tracker for all of the crypto currency that available in the market. <br>It is hard to keep track of the prices of crypto currency because it always updates every minute and unlike the regular foreign exchange market, crypto currency market is much more changing. <br>This application already gives you the average price of the crypto currencies out there from any other exchanges because this currency varies in prices at any other exchanges that listed on the app.

<br>One great feature of this is you have a visual presentation of how the price movement goes over an hour or a day with in the price graph.<br>

<br><h2>Last would be Microsoft Word.</h2> <br><h5>I can’t work on my assignments mostly without Microsoft Word.<br></h5>

<br>AVAILABILITY

One of the most obvious benefits is its availability. Almost all windows users install Microsoft suit in their computer system. It is available and used on all common computers. <br>Microsoft word is used to save documents. The documents can be copied to flash drive which serves as an external memory for your computer. <br> This allows you to use the saved documents conveniently taking with you anywhere.

Furthermore allowing you to create simple documents. <br> It helps you greatly to create and design business cards, brochures, new letters and many more items that are needed. <br>Besides, the use of fonts, shapes, clip art or smart art, charts has its own importance and value.

An extremely important feature of Microsoft word <br>which is very useful for me is that it has a save feature which you can recover the last document you used after getting <br> an power interruption or any other scenarios that may cause your pc to malfunction.
