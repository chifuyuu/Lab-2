</br>To start, our first quiz was unexpected, and I thought it was a good way to pointing on how important it is for a website having a very well-designed UI and UX.</br>  Taking this quiz, makes me realize that as an end user, we sometimes don’t read what we click on a website. We just click what we think is common or already experienced before on navigating through websites.</br> In the first few minutes of the quiz, I really don’t know what is happening. I just became pressured when everyone is already done and know what the steps navigating through it. </br>I can’t even past the first part of the quiz so I was already nervous if I will be the last one to pass the quiz. In the mid part, we already have insights on what to do to finish the quiz in a good time. It was to read every single word that is being required to proceed on to the next parts.</br>
So, overall having this kind of interface in a website will mess someone’s time up and most importantly, it would give a lot of headaches to those who would be using it. </br>May even give inconsistent data since, end users cannot understand what they are doing in the website. We experienced that, creating a good UI and UX is important so that end users would not be bothered and had a lot of hard time as we did in our quiz  you need to put your all focus and mind into it and then you’ll get it.

</br>I think my experience in our first week of USERDES class was a huge success because I think everyone in the class are in the same pace which no one is being left behind. </br>I also like how the professor approach us to lighten the atmosphere in the class. </br>I am not overwhelmed or nervous at all even if I am talking in front of the class and presenting my work. </br>The class overall has having a great time in User design class since everyone has the chance to present their work in front and no one is tasked to go there since it’s your choice to either share your ideas in front or not.</br>  

 

</br>I also like the activities given to us because we really are assigned to think and share our thoughts. Like how we created the activity 3 it was a good way to test how can we create a solution to a problem which is not even yet present in the real world. This way we can improve our critical thinking which we really need in the future or in the workplace. Overall it was fun and knowledgeable at the same time. Hoping next week would even enjoyable than I would expect and of course a lot of activities await. 	</p>
