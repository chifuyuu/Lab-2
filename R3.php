 </br>My first web application using GitHub and Heroku was very exciting and hard at the same time. It was my first time also using GitHub. </br> So, I think it was normal to encounter so many problems, like I was not able to push my work from a different computer. </br> Another thing is that it is hard to commit, push, and upload files to GitHub for me because I don’t know what commands to use and I needed to consult YouTube on how to do it.
 </br>
 </br>Starting this webpage task is challenging since everything is new for me.  </br>This is my first time to use php, css, html.  So, I consulted YouTube for tutorials on how to create web pages and how to create a good one.  </br>Since, I don’t know much what the YouTuber is telling me about, so I also tried searching on the internet on the terms or codes to use for a specific thing.  </br>I also like Heroku since I can easily visit the website I make and can also be accessed on my phone’s browser as well, which is somehow satisfying because I can share my website to my friends as well though, my webpage is not yet that good when seen in the phone but I think we will get to that. 
 </br> </br>
 </br>Overall, the use of GitHub and Heroku in our first webpage/website was a fun experience because we learned new things which I think is really needed in the field of IT/CS. I’m looking forward to creating more better webpage in the future, since it is beneficial for us overall and can express creativity.
